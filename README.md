# Active Blur - kwin script

## Description

Blur the wallpaper if a windows is active.

### history

This is a tentative to export my wallpaper plugin [blurred wallpaper](https://github.com/bouteillerAlan/blurredwallpaper) to kwin script.

The idea is that having it via kwin script will make it work with any type of wallpaper plugin.

## Installation
